welcome to the Ted interview I'm Chris Addison and this is the series where I sit down with a speaker and weak to dive deeper into their ideas and was possible during that Ted talk but today I couldn't be more excited because I'm here with none other than Sir Ken Robinson second is the man responsible for the most viewed Ted Talk of all time in more than 50 million times now I told called do schools kill creativity he recorded it back in 2006 it was one of the first six TED Talks we ever released and probably that talk did as much as any of that to really put TED Talks is a hole on the map I had a great story was that in a drawing lessons she was six inches of the back drawing and the teacher said this little gal's not ever paid attention I new Jordan that she did and the teacher was and she said and the girl said I'm drawing a picture of God and the teacher said but nobody knows what God looks like the idea he's talked about since it really struck a nerve with people it felt as if millions and millions of people around the world have had this experience of being at school and somehow their own creativity not being recognized or felt or developed properly integrated Petit we grow out of it has been a scholar of Education pretty much
