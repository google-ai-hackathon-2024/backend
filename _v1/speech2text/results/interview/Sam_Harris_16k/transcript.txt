most people probably here think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life is worth living for what is worth dying for what constitutes a good life argue that this is an illusion of the separation between science and human values is an illusion and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history

Sam:
the debate is over the nature of morality is there such a thing as objective moral truth or is morality inherently subjective omura statements are ultimately just statements about the values and individual or account share happens to hold threats give me example yet I mean if I say something like it's wrong to lie or we should all stop using animals as your personal moral values in which they can object to flee be judged to be true or false if you believe in God doesn't easy enough answer this question good is what God has revealed to us it's good he's crazy human beings with consciences and with the holy book that sets out what is right and what is wrong but most Las Vegas academic scientists don't think you can Outsource Morales you to God they would say there's a fundamental difference in the world between facts and values back to the statements about the they can be true or false values are human Creations they differ between different cultures we can debate them but ultimately there is no objective opposite of the truth of a moral statement doesn't believe in God he does believe the statements about moral values are ultimately objective statements his you we can discover the truth about those statements through another defendant age of science of psychology for example of how human societies off right and exercise of reason is wrong and the majority of scientists and philosophers the right then it's hard to see how that can be such a thing as morale program if the moral system is simply the subjective values that a culture creates the put the limit on how much you can argue against views you disagree with like the sanctity of life or child marriage you just have no real answer to the position look this is what I and my family going back Generations choose to believe
