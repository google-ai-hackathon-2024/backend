Chris:
welcome to the Ted interview I'm Chris Addison this is the podcast Series where I sit down with the Chesapeake up and we get to dive much deeper into their ideas that was possible during that Ted talk to August is Islamic scholar Dalia mogahed the world today when 9/11 happened Dahlia to myself into a research project with Gallop in which 50000 Muslims were interviewed around the world about that lives that dreams the current stated that religion that was such became a book called who speaks for Islam and then in 2016 how old would flight be a Muslim in America was an attempt to Defuse The Assam a phobia that is Rife in so many parts of the world

Dalia:
when you look at me Faith an expert maybe even a sister or oppressed brainwashed a terrorist some of your perceptions were negative I don't really blame you that's just how the media has been portraying people who look like me

Chris:
it was certainly an incredibly disarming talk she got a big Standing Ovation and changed I think how a lot of people thought about Muslims and Islam is often criticized for the actions taken in its name so my goal with this conversation is to understand Islam better but at the same time not shying away from hard question. I'm delighted to have you here today that when he was a remarkable talk to you guys I guess it's so tempting to categorize people we know and not talk you helped us know you what was the reaction to the

Dalia:
talk well I I I I really wanted that talk to be a gift I wanted it to be a a contribution to the audience's understanding I I I wanted to be up there to give them the gift of a new idea and what came out of it was such a almost like that a magical reception I mean I had so many people tell me how much they they learned and how much they really changed I remember one one particular person which right after the talk actually at the conference he was there as security for one of your guests I'm not sure who and he said I I think that I was really struggling with some of these ideas you were talking about I I think that I I was really suffering from some form of phobia but your talk completely changed my mind and I want to thank you and I've got these messages from all over the world since the talk I I remember one I got from Jerusalem a Jewish Israeli wrote me and said that she related so much to the ideas of the talk and how often times her father who's an orthodox Jew is mistaken for a Muslim when he's traveling in Europe and and he's himself ironically has suffered from islamophobia so I I thought it was it was a great opportunity to to build a bridge to reveal a little bit more about the humanity of of Ordinary People of Muslims and and it was really important to me at the end of the talk to make sure that no one thought I was an exception that no one could sort of dismiss my experiences just that one person with the exception to all other is I I really do believe that I'm entirely ordinary and my story is so representative of so many other people
