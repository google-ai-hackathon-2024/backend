John:
we should not legalize prostitution we've been done the status quo there are number of the pieces that are associated with prostitution whether it's the fact that pins and John's are able to abuse prostitutes themselves whether it's the transmission of sexually transmitted disease through prostitution whether it's the fact that people are oftentimes coerced into entering the prostitution Market in the first place we think that legalizing prostitution is the wrong way to go about alleviating these abuses and furthermore we think that when you legalize prostitution you owe me in French is a business and make it more likely that those abusus will move out first when I talk about why those abuses of more likely become prevalent in a legalized prostitution market and then we're going to talk about Alternatives if you actually care about alleviating those types of abuses so recognize that in the status quo women are often coerced into choosing or entering prostitution it's not a free choice this may be because they're experiencing economic hardship and maybe because they've been blocked out of the employment fear because they may have a prior conviction that doesn't allow them to get employment or they may not have the education necessary to do so and therefore they enter prostitution for the more John's and Tim's not to believe this can range from physical abuse being done against prostitute the process of being not being paid for their services we think that legalization going to do a few things personally it increases the incentive for people to enter the business and therefore just without any other changes to the structure of prostitution itself it's more likely to increase those harms as well we also think it makes it harder to punishment legalize prostitution you make it harder for women to go against these people because there's already a stigma it's more difficult for a woman to go against their to go to the police and say the person that I was being the product the John that I had me or JPay me or do these type of things against those people and now if they go forward and ask for some sort of relief they're only going to be viewed as having some sort of casualty of the job that not being paid of being abused as part of the job of prostitution we think it's also unlikely to drive out illicit business so we drink in the status quo prostitution is obviously a mostly illicit business is mostly done underground structures that allow for that type of business to exist that black market to exist aren't undermined by the legalization of prostitution we think that there are different types of there different levels to the prostitution Market that exists there high class and there are street prostitutes and we don't think that legalization is going to alleviate the guard of the illicit street-level markets that exist in the status quo because most people simply would not be able to access the higher end market so what do you think is more likely to occur within that you're only going to perpetuate the historical practice of objectifying women we think that while women are able to choose prostitution sometimes as I explained its large be a coerced conviction based businesses which women are coerced into answering and it only perpetuates the objectification of women in the use of women solely for their bodies we think this is a historical pattern that exists throughout western eastern all cultures we don't think that legalization makes it any less likely that this is going to end makes it any more likely that this is going to stop and ask such we can get some clean the case legalized you continue to perpetuate patriarchal ideas of objectification in a hyper-sexualization of women we think that a better Avenue would be to increase protections for prostitute to create laws that punish John's and punish pins but don't punish prostitute because this ensures that the horse and structures that Abused Women in the status quo are able to be legislated against they are able to be struck down under B twice in the market and making it easier for people to do these types of the of abuses in broad daylight and increase is the objectification of women which is already a problem in our modern society and Confused we should not legalize prostitution we should not legalize prostitution
