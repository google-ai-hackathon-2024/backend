It's not going to happen because people have been gambling for thousands of years people rather enjoy gambling it's a pretty ingrained part of our culture we have entire cities dedicated to it you know like there gambling in Las Vegas obviously I'm pretty sure there's a lot of gambling and places like a lot Israel as well there's all kinds of like please have these are in a few things like that involved in the resistance about the cities and livelihoods are being destroyed and a whole lot of resistance to all be kind of far more importantly it completely internet there's nothing really different countries or you can even if like the websites are under like any kind of certain set of laws there's always ways that you can use the internet to avoid detection and I highly doubt that the government is going to dedicate like legit military all kind of Technical and physical and monetary resources play billions of dollars that it would be a complete waste of time and you're not making the money off of gambling anymore you can't you can't profit off of it so a lot of money in revenue is going away additionally when you ban something and it becomes a part of the black market is more likely to be unsafe you're more like I'm going to have like Prime Mortgage really enforced things to make sure that like he's obviously gambling is random and to a large extent and things like that but enforcement to make sure that like you aren't being as a gambler like completely screwed over by the people house for sale but nothing wrong with the gambling on rather immoral to Dad in the first place because keep in mind that when people are gambling they're usually gambling with their own usually gambling with their own not other people so that's money that you've earned that money that you can do what you want you should have the right to spend your money on the way you walk because you work for it but it definitely gambling doesn't harm anyone it's not like it's kind of big things like crime or whatever. Like maybe also keep in mind that like the black market argument that I made by how that's not can be sauce anyways so other than maybe like spend your money that you earned that way if you want them for those reasons we should not ban gambling spend your money that you earned that way if you want them for those reasons we should not ban gambling",
