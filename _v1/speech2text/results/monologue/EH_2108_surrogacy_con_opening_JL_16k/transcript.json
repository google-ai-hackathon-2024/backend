        "contents": "two points today one on the market failure created by Third World Nations and two on a woman's right to her body before that whole bunch of refutation one we're told surrogacy is inherently exploitive why because a woman who's never been pregnant can't understand three responses to that one people can still choose to get pregnant for themselves even though a woman who's never been pregnant before supposedly can't understand the harm that does to her body if that's the case why can't I do choose to do it for myself but not for someone else moreover why can't I choose to do it when they gain for myself as a child but not when the game for myself if the money that enables me to feed my child has been tireli unclear to we simply don't accept that people who can't understand it or they don't know how to feel the pain but looks like I don't need to have been in a car crash to know that I don't want to experience and that is quite painful women don't need to be pregnant to re-up it recognized that the specific terms that have to do to pregnancy other specific harm how did this some women don't happen to other don't accept that education does not solve for this last week even if it's at their worst they can regulate to ensure that people that the only people allowed to be surrogate or those people who have had a child before this a good time to point out we are old for regulation of surrogacy we are all for regulating the contract regulating the prices regulating the participants of surrogacy we're simply not for Banning it be they say they're going to go to be created artificially low prices to responses to this a regulated minimum price of parents that are being described to us off and have an incentive to pay more and more just to get the minimally better thing so you can hike up the price for playing Mozart at night before the baby goes to sleep tight up the price for eating food that the better the mother anyway that means I can get more money and better treatment of themselves simultaneously see he says Society doesn't allow prostitution and this is the same two responses a it's not the same the Dignity of a prostitute is taken away by allowing her entire body to be owned by somebody else in the case of a surrogate you maintain your ability to choose your day-to-day activities to act freely as you otherwise would and you maintain your dignity if for no other reason than for societal perception be many societies do allow prostitution is when it's done with regulation we're not entirely sure why they just assert its the same and a circle that's a negative thing lastly he talks about course he says it's difficult to decide between a mother and a contract note that this is not the case that the surrogate is a mother she's genetically unrelated she carried the baby to term secondly he says this is going to close the courts a precedent is set once precedent is set just doesn't get discussed for very long and be met so it clogs the course that's not a real issue let's talk about the real issues one there's a market failure even if you do as James wants to ban It in America that it in England if you desire to have a child genetically related to yours is enormous it is so big that people go to places like India people go to places like Calcutta to have this. What does this mean it means that all the harms James is afraid of happens tenfold there when you can't ensure proper regulation and where you have a surrogate farms in order to sell these women at low prices to Rich Americans and keep most of the game for essentially their pimps so even if they do this nothing is actually solve your just passing the buck along two more unfortunate women and worse conditions we're going to get this done worse to them secondly you say a woman has a right to her body that right includes the siding note The Logical links are a woman today can decide to get pregnant a woman today can decide to sell her body and labor form as in you can choose to do intensive labor work such as construction for example a woman today can decide to abort the child to give it up for adoption or to keep a child where is the jump from all of these decisions she's allowed to make to the one that says she's not which is instead of making a child for herself making a child for someone else without properly analyzing why that defeat a woman's ability to think rationally they simply cannot win this debate for all these reasons incredibly proud to propose to a pose",
