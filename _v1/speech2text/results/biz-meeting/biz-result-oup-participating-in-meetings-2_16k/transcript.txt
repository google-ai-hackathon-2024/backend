right I shall we get started well we're here to talk about the new training program for the cool Sensei David I asked you to come because you were involved in the market research we did so I thought you could get us a short summary of The findings and Anna obviously it's your customer service teams will be affected by this so we thought you might have some ideas on the the training program and Maria will be developing on running the training okay David could you run us through the main points from the research we walked with a market research agency over a period of a few weeks to gather information about our customers and what they thought about us and the results were mixed the three system had there been complaints or a compliance yes but also we are losing customers in the region and we wanted to know why so I'm not sure what's the research about getting customer point of view or about customer profiles right I see you so the results showed a few areas where customers were not happy one of the most common how shall I put it issues was with the Kohl Center well basically it seems that the customers feel they are not getting good service and they are leaving us for another

Maria:
supplier right saying customers are leaving us because of the service from the stuff or could there be other reasons to you I mean could it be that we haven't got very good systems in place.

Paul:
Yeah could be I

Maria:
have no problem with giving the staff a refresher course but starting completely from scratch seems like a waste of time and money they will receive training when they start anyway yes that's a good points on that and we don't

Paul:
know yet if we will have to start from scratch it may be that we haven't done enough to monitor their activity and that's a simple refresher course will be enough or it may be that we have to look at customer contact from start to finish I'm trying to implement some new protocols.

Maria:
Guess that's why I'm sure there's a way of dealing with a sensitive late I know I realize it's not easy for you to suggest more training for yourself so I wonder if we could start with a review of the current reigning approach and look at what we need to do to address the problems brought up in the survey we could do that but I would need to look at the full report first of course I know I understand your point about possibly wasting time and money is so perhaps you and I could look at the report together yes okay then we'll be able to decide what needs addressing and tell if it's not raining or even a complete systems

Paul:
overhaul good idea I bought them copies of the reports perhaps we could start with the highlights fist good idea I bought them copies of the reports perhaps we could start with the highlights fist
