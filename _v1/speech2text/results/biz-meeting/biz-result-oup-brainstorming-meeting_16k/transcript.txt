Paul:
improving our performance with customers he's all about changing the company culture so we need a message or slogan between even need an image that everyone sees every day on that desk to remind them of the go like a mission statement

Marcus:
sort of

Paul:
something short and instantly recognizable mission statements tend to be forgotten all that too long but I don't want to rule out any ideas at this stage what does I'd like us to do this morning is spend an hour or so brainstorming some ideas to see what we can come up with just a reminder this is a rainstorm so all ideas are welcome we're not touch with valuate the ideas yet we just want to get as many as possible to get to stuff it should begin with the word customer in the center and see what comes from that okay does anyone have any other fools maybe it's too early in the day I was

Marcus:
thinking of good customer service or maybe you're looking for something more catchy

Paul:
don't feel you have to come up with a slogan or anything let's just get some ideas in front of us Customer Care

Marcus:
customer service sorry wake up at 1 already how about doing things Becca customers doing things back to what do you mean oh I didn't know that we were only thinking about using the word customer I was trying to think of what it is that we're actually trying to do but I think Marcus is looking for something more about the customer

Paul:
know I'm not looking for anything definite at this stage I really want this just to be a brainstorm so anything is fine we don't need any discussion at this stage about what some good or bad let's just focus on generating ideas so what exactly did you say

Marcus:
doing things better

Paul:
doing things better good anyone

Marcus:
else Festivus more helpful

Paul:
getting back together good getting some nice ideas now

Marcus:
do you want something that tell stuff what they need to do or what do you want something that reminds them of the goal Marcus

Paul:
don't say something David you being very quiet so far and he comments sorry yes I was just thinking that we need to think of where we are now and where we have to get to can you elaborate I mean at the moment we don't even offer what some of our competitors can offer in terms of customer service we have to equal then I like that

Marcus:
an equal symbol is. So useful image one thing I go beyond what customers would normally expect if we only provide what other companies do in terms of level of service than that isn't enough so in that case this pops

Paul:
plus customers customers + customers + 1

Marcus:
the customer plus program very nice

Paul:
the customer plus program

Marcus:
what do you think I like it

Paul:
and it would be a good name if you wanted to offer some kind of loyalty program will rewards for coming back to us and I agree but let's keep a few more ideas coming we can come back to this one later not so far we've been thinking about this very much from our own perspective it would be useful to think about view you said doing things better explore that's a bit more from the customer's perspective if you were the customer what would you want us to do better

Marcus:
speaking as a customer I'd say I want my calls answered more quickly

Paul:
that they want me to explain my problem not that I'm some sort of interruption to the day let me know some of these words we have the Masa listen want to help it makes me think that the customer is our business

Marcus:
Bostitch

Paul:
well let's see where these Takis well let's see where these Takis
