## 2012 US President Debate: Biden vs. Ryan

**TOPIC:** The Benghazi attack and its implications for US foreign policy

**DEBATOR 1: Joe Biden**

* **Argument 1:** The Obama administration failed to adequately protect the US consulate in Benghazi, leading to the deaths of four Americans.
* **Argument 2:** The administration was slow to acknowledge that the attack was a terrorist act, instead initially blaming it on a protest.
* **Argument 3:** The administration's handling of the Benghazi attack is indicative of a broader problem with its foreign policy, which is making the world more chaotic and less safe.

**DEBATOR 2: Paul Ryan**

* **Argument 1:** The Obama administration did everything it could to protect the US consulate in Benghazi, but it was ultimately overwhelmed by the attackers.
* **Argument 2:** The administration was initially unsure of the nature of the attack, but it quickly corrected its assessment and took steps to bring the perpetrators to justice.
* **Argument 3:** The Benghazi attack is a tragedy, but it should not be used to undermine the Obama administration's foreign policy, which has made the world a safer place.
