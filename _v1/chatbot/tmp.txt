 'answer': 'The meaning of the tax depends on the context in which it is used. In the context of the 2012 US President Debate, the tax refers to the federal income tax. The federal income tax is a tax that is levied on the income of individuals, corporations, and other entities. The tax is used to fund government programs and services.\n\nIn the context of the debate, President Obama and Governor Romney have different views on how the tax should be used. President Obama believes that the tax should be used to invest in education and training, develop new sources of energy, and rebuild America. Governor Romney believes that the tax should be used to cut taxes for the wealthy and rollback regulations.\n\nThe debate over the tax is a complex one, and there is no easy answer. Ultimately, it is up to the voters to decide how the tax should be used.\n'}
